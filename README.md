# ⚔ roguelike project ⚔

This is a hobby project aimed at creating a roguelike game using Rust programming language and the `bracket-lib` library. Please note that this project is currently a work in progress and is incomplete.

## About

This project is an attempt to create a classic roguelike game using Rust and the `bracket-lib` library. The goal is to implement features such as player movement, entity interactions, procedural map generation, and more.

## Project Status

As of now, the project is in its early stages of development. Basic functionality, such as player movement and rendering entities, has been implemented. However, there is still much work to be done to create a fully featured roguelike experience.

## Getting Started

To run the game locally, you'll need Rust and Cargo installed on your machine. Clone the repository and use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jossse69/roguelike_project.git
cd roguelike_project
cargo run
```
